This is version 1.0 of the free edition of the book
TeX for the Impatient, released under the GNU Free Documentation License.
(This HEADER.html file itself is public domain.)

<p>Primary distribution point:
       <a href="ftp://tug.org/tex/impatient/">ftp://tug.org/tex/impatient</a>
  aka <a href="http://tug.org/ftp/tex/impatient/">http://tug.org/ftp/tex/impatient/</a>.
It is also available from any CTAN node at
<a
href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/impatient/">/tex-archive/info/impatient</a>.

<p>Information about the free edition is included at the end of the
preface and on the copyright page.  The book was originally published by
Addison-Wesley in 1990; we (the authors) regained the rights in 2003 and
made it available under the GFDL.

<p>We'd be interested in hearing about any projects undertaken with this
material.  See <a href="errata.future">errata.future</a> for some
relatively small ideas for enhancements.  Our email address: <a
href="mailto:impatient@tug.org">impatient@tug.org</a>.


<p>Some random thoughts for people thinking of working with the source:

<ul>
<li>You may want to translate the source into some more standard format; we
used many homegrown macros to make typing and markup easier.

<li>You may also want to redo the index creation to use makeindex or
some other standard program, instead of our homegrown Icon programs <a
href="index1.icn">index1.icn</a> and <a href="index2.icn">index2.icn</a>
(included in the distribution, for what it's worth).  Until the index
can be easily regenerated, the page breaks can't change without the
index becoming useless.

<li>Printing the GFDL required many kludges, a true Eplain-compatible
version is needed (which in turn would require using the current eplain
to print the book).

</ul>

<p>Happy TeX'ing.
